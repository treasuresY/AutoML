It has also been fine-tuned on ImageNet 2012, which is a similar dataset to yours. Additionally, it has a relatively fast runtime, which meets your requirement for quick response.\n\n2. microsoft/beit-base-patch16-224-pt22k-ft22k: This model has also been pre-trained on a large dataset of 14 million images and 21,841 classes, and fine-tuned on the same dataset at the same resolution as yours. It has a high accuracy rate and can handle complex image classification tasks. However, it may have a slightly longer runtime than the first model.\n\n3. facebook/deit-base-distilled-patch16-224: This model has been pre-trained and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k, which is a smaller dataset than the previous two models. However, it has been distilled to be more data-efficient and has a faster runtime. It may be a good choice if you have limited computational resources or need a quick response time.",
