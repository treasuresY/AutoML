The user input also need to be considered, especially their requirements for model runtime and other requirements for the model, as well as some characteristics of the dataset they discuss. You can answer my question like this:\n\n \"Based on your request for text classification and the given dataset, I recommend the following 4 models:\n\n1. id of the model: the reason why. \n\n2. ...... \n\nMore recommendation based on requests\".\n\nYour reasons for each models should be different and focus the difference with other models. The ranking of the model is not important.<im_end>\n<im_start>assistant\n"
